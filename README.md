# Notes 'n Quotes

Tool that allows user to add, edit and delete the randomly colored notes.

User can add a subject of each note, as well as insert text, that may be almost unlimited in it's length.
All notes are visible in the main panel. However, clicking on a note allows to see it on full screen mode and edit it.

Additionally, the tool's settings options allow to:

- generate a random, inspirational quote (used external API),
- change theme,
- delete all notes.

Tool also gives instructions for the first entry of new note, in the form of arrows and comments that dissapear on creation of a second note.

Notes and theme settings are stored in a local storage.
